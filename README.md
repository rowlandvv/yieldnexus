## 🚀 Overview

Yield Nexus revolutionizes DeFi yield farming on Stacks by automatically routing funds across multiple strategies to maximize returns while managing risk. Users deposit once and let the protocol handle the complex optimization, rebalancing, and compounding operations.

### Core Innovation

- **🎯 Multi-Strategy Routing**: Diversify across multiple yield sources automatically
- **⚖️ Risk-Adjusted Vaults**: Conservative, Moderate, and Aggressive strategies
- **🔄 Auto-Compounding**: Reinvest yields automatically for exponential growth
- **📊 Dynamic Rebalancing**: Optimize allocations based on real-time performance
- **💎 Gas-Efficient Harvesting**: Batch operations to minimize transaction costs
- **🛡️ Risk Management**: Built-in safeguards and emergency withdrawal options

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Vault System
- **Risk Tiers**: Conservative (stable), Moderate (balanced), Aggressive (high-yield)
- **Auto-Compounding**: Automatic reinvestment of yields
- **Performance Tracking**: Real-time APY and performance metrics
- **Capacity Management**: Vault caps to ensure optimal performance

### 2. Strategy Management
- **Multiple Strategies**: Up to 10 strategies per vault
- **Dynamic Allocation**: Adjustable percentages based on performance
- **Risk Assessment**: Each strategy rated for risk level
- **Performance History**: Track returns over time

### 3. Fee Structure
| Fee Type | Rate | Description |
|----------|------|-------------|
| Performance | 2% | On profits only |
| Management | 0.5% | Annual fee |
| Withdrawal | 0.1% | Standard withdrawal |
| Emergency | 5% | Emergency exit penalty |

### 4. Yield Optimization
```
Current Yield Sources:
- Lending Protocols: 5-10% APY
- Liquidity Provision: 10-20% APY
- Staking Rewards: 8-15% APY
- Arbitrage Strategies: Variable
```

## 💻 Smart Contract Interface

### User Functions

#### `deposit`
```clarity
(deposit (vault-id uint) (amount uint))
```
Deposit STX into a yield-generating vault.

#### `withdraw`
```clarity
(withdraw (vault-id uint) (shares uint))
```
Withdraw your funds plus earned yields.

#### `compound`
```clarity
(compound (vault-id uint))
```
Manually compound your earnings for maximum growth.

#### `emergency-withdraw`
```clarity
(emergency-withdraw (vault-id uint))
```
Exit immediately with a 5% penalty.

### Vault Operations

#### `harvest`
```clarity
(harvest (vault-id uint))
```
Collect yields from all strategies (24-hour cooldown).

#### `rebalance`
```clarity
(rebalance (vault-id uint))
```
Optimize strategy allocations based on performance.

### Read Functions

- `get-vault`: Vault details and performance
- `get-user-position`: Your shares and earnings
- `get-user-balance`: Current value of position
- `get-vault-apy`: Current annual percentage yield
- `get-total-value-locked`: Protocol TVL
- `can-harvest`: Check harvest availability

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Basic Flow
```clarity
;; Deposit into moderate risk vault
(contract-call? .yield-nexus deposit u1 u10000000) ;; 10 STX

;; Check your balance after yield generation
(contract-call? .yield-nexus get-user-balance u1 tx-sender)
;; Returns: u10500000 (5% gain)

;; Compound earnings
(contract-call? .yield-nexus compound u1)

;; Withdraw funds + yields
(contract-call? .yield-nexus withdraw u1 all-shares)
```

### Vault Selection
```clarity
;; Conservative Vault (5-8% APY)
(contract-call? .yield-nexus deposit u1 u100000000)

;; Moderate Vault (10-15% APY)
(contract-call? .yield-nexus deposit u2 u100000000)

;; Aggressive Vault (15-25% APY)
(contract-call? .yield-nexus deposit u3 u100000000)
```

### Yield Harvesting
```clarity
;; Anyone can trigger harvest (earns small reward)
(contract-call? .yield-nexus harvest u1)
;; Returns: { yield: u500000, fee: u10000, net: u490000 }
```

## 🎯 Strategy Examples

### Conservative Strategies
- **Stablecoin Lending**: Low risk, steady 5-7% APY
- **Blue-chip Staking**: Established protocols, 6-8% APY
- **Insured Vaults**: Protected principal, 4-6% APY

### Moderate Strategies
- **LP Provision**: Major pairs, 10-15% APY
- **Yield Farming**: Established farms, 12-18% APY
- **Leveraged Staking**: 2x leverage, 15-20% APY

### Aggressive Strategies
- **New Protocol Farming**: High risk/reward, 20-50% APY
- **Arbitrage Bots**: Market inefficiency capture
- **Leveraged Yield**: 3-5x leverage positions

## 🔄 Auto-Compounding Magic

### Compound Effect Over Time
```
Initial: 100 STX at 15% APY

Without Compounding:
- Year 1: 115 STX
- Year 2: 130 STX
- Year 3: 145 STX

With Daily Compounding:
- Year 1: 116.18 STX
- Year 2: 134.98 STX
- Year 3: 156.83 STX
